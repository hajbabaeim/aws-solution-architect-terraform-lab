# Contributing to AWS Solution Architect Terraform Lab

First off, thank you for considering contributing to AWS Solution Architect Terraform Lab. It's people like you that make AWS Solution Architect Terraform Lab such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make one! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork AWS Solution Architect Terraform Lab and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-translations
```
